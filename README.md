This chat app allows multiple users to register via telnet.
Each user receives a greeting message upon registering.
Users can broadcast messages to each other.
Users can change their names using the /nick flag, and when they do, the name change is broadcast to all users including the user who requested the change.
The tests confirm that users receive a greeting upon logging in, and that users receive messages from one another.
